#Multi-level CSV (csv_ml)

csv_ml attempts to provide a simple unambiguous format for representing structured data that includes schema definition.

csv_ml is expected to
- save storage space
- increase data transfer speeds
- be faster to parse compared to XML and JSON
- allow full schema definition and validation
- make schema definition simple, lightweight and in-line compared to DTD or XML Schema
- allow database binding
- be used in EAI (Application Integration) for import and export of data
- be simpler to parse, allowing data to be available even in low memory devices
