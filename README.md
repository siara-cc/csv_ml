#Multi-level CSV (csv_ml)

csv_ml attempts to provide a simple unambiguous format for representing structured data that includes schema definition.

csv_ml is expected to
- save storage space
- data transfer speeds
- faster to parse compared to XML and JSON
- full schema definition and validation
- schema definition simple, lightweight and in-line compared to DTD or XML Schema
- database binding
- used in EAI (Application Integration) for import and export of data
- simpler to parse, allowing data to be available even in low memory devices
